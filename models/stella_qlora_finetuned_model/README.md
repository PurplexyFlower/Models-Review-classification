- **E-commerce Platforms**: Filter suspicious reviews automatically
- **Market Research**: Analyze review quality in datasets
- **Content Moderation**: Identify potentially fraudulent reviews

### Usage Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from peft import PeftModel
import torch

# Load the base model and tokenizer
base_model_name = "NovaSearch/stella_en_400M_v5"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)

# Load the fine-tuned model
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model_name, "path/to/checkpoint-5460")

# Example usage
text = "This product is amazing! Great quality and fast shipping."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True, padding=True)

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(predictions, dim=-1)
    
# 0 = Real Review, 1 = Fake Review
print(f"Prediction: {'Fake' if predicted_class.item() == 1 else 'Real'}")
print(f"Confidence: {predictions.max().item():.4f}")
```

### Hardware Requirements

#### Training Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with at least 6-8GB VRAM
- **CUDA**: Compatible CUDA version
- **Memory**: 16GB+ system RAM recommended

#### Inference Requirements
- **GPU**: Any CUDA-compatible GPU (2GB+ VRAM)
- **CPU**: Can run on CPU (slower inference)

### Out-of-Scope Use

This model should not be used for:
- **General text classification tasks** outside of review classification
- **Languages other than English**
- **Reviews from domains significantly different from training data**
- **Critical decision-making** without human oversight

## Model Architecture

### Technical Implementation

The model implements a custom Stella-based classification architecture:
- **Base Stella encoder** for contextualized embeddings
- **Custom classification head** with dropout and linear layers
- **QLoRA adapters** on attention projection layers
- **Binary cross-entropy loss** for classification

### Memory Optimization Techniques
- **4-bit Quantization**: Reduces model memory footprint by ~75%
- **LoRA**: Only trains ~0.16% of parameters (adapters only)
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulates larger batch sizes with limited memory
- **Mixed Precision**: Uses BFloat16/Float16 for faster training

### Stella-Specific Optimizations
- **Target Modules**: Optimized for Stella's qkv_proj and o_proj layers
- **Learning Rate**: Tuned specifically for Stella's architecture
- **Sequence Processing**: Leverages Stella's efficient text encoding

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Limitations
- The model is trained specifically for review classification and may not generalize to other text classification tasks
- Performance may vary on reviews from domains not represented in the training data
- Quantization may introduce minor accuracy trade-offs compared to full-precision models

### Biases
- The model inherits any biases present in the training dataset
- May perform differently across different product categories or review styles
- Potential bias toward certain language patterns or writing styles

### Recommendations

- **Always validate** model predictions in production environments
- **Monitor performance** across different product domains
- **Use with human oversight** for critical applications
- **Test thoroughly** on your specific use case before deployment
- **Consider domain adaptation** if your reviews differ significantly from training data
